## Aruco Marker Detection and Pose Estimation with OpenCV

This project offers a comprehensive solution for generating, detecting, and estimating the pose of ArUco markers using OpenCV and Python. It empowers real-time marker interaction, making it valuable for various applications like:

* Augmented Reality (AR)
* Robotic Vision
* Interactive Systems

**Project Structure:**

* **Marker Generation:** Create customizable ArUco markers from predefined dictionaries.
* **Marker Detection:** Implements real-time detection using a webcam, highlighting markers visually.
* **Pose Estimation:** Calculates 3D orientation and position of detected markers relative to the camera.

**Getting Started:**

Before diving in, ensure you have:

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV with `opencv-contrib-python` package (for ArUco module)

**Installation:**

1. Download and install Python 3.x from official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install OpenCV with additional contributions using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

**Running the Code:**

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the desired script with Python. (e.g., generate and detect markers)

```bash
python generate_and_detect_aruco.py
```

**Adjust the `aruco_type` variable within the script to change the marker dictionary type.**

**Project Features:**

* **Marker Generation:** Create customizable ArUco markers from various dictionaries.
* **Marker Detection:** Real-time detection with visual highlighting and ID display within the video feed.
* **Pose Estimation:** Calculates 3D pose (orientation and position) of detected markers relative to the camera.
* **Configuration:** Modify marker types, camera settings, and pose estimation parameters within the scripts for specific needs.

**Possible Enhancements:**

* Integration with AR SDKs for advanced AR applications.
* User interface development for easier interaction.
* Extension to multi-marker systems for improved spatial recognition.
