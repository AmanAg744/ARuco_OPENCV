ArUco Marker Generation, Detection, and Pose Estimation with OpenCV
This repository presents a versatile project designed for the generation, detection, and pose estimation of ArUco markers using the OpenCV library. Employing a combination of Python and OpenCV, this project showcases real-time marker detection and estimation capabilities, essential for numerous applications such as augmented reality (AR), robotic vision, and interactive systems.

Project Structure
The project is divided into three key components:

Marker Generation: Utilizes OpenCV to generate a variety of ArUco markers across different predefined dictionaries, enabling customization for various applications.
Marker Detection: Implements real-time detection of ArUco markers using a webcam or any other video capture device, with the capability to denote detected markers visually within the feed.
Pose Estimation: Executes 3D pose estimation for each detected marker, calculating its orientation and position relative to the camera, crucial for AR implementations and robotics.
Getting Started
Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Python 3.x
OpenCV with opencv-contrib-python package for extended functionalities, including ArUco module support.
Installation
Install Python 3.x from the official Python website.

Install OpenCV with additional contributions package using pip:

bash

pip install opencv-contrib-python
Running the Code
Clone this repository or download the source code.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the desired script using Python. Example for generating and detecting ArUco markers:

bash

python generate_and_detect_aruco.py
Adjust aruco_type variable within the script to change the dictionary type for marker generation and detection.

Marker Generation
This functionality allows for the creation of ArUco markers across various predefined dictionaries. The script generates images of ArUco markers which can then be printed or displayed onscreen for detection and pose estimation.

Marker Detection
Through real-time video capture, the project detects ArUco markers, visually highlighting them and displaying their IDs within the video feed. This demonstrates the capacity to recognize and track these markers in dynamic environments.

Pose Estimation
Once a marker is detected, the script calculates its pose - orientation and position relative to the camera frame. This is pivotal for understanding the marker's placement in 3D space, offering invaluable data for AR projects and robotic navigation systems.

Configuration
You can customize marker dictionary types, camera settings, and pose estimation parameters by altering the respective variables within the scripts, tailoring the project to meet specific requirements or experimental conditions.

Possible Enhancements
Integration with AR SDKs for more complex augmented reality implementations.
Development of an interface for easier interaction and parameter adjustments.
Extension to multi-marker systems for improved spatial recognition and tracking accuracy.
